## Motion of a classical particle in a box

Here we will describe the motion of a classical particle inside a box with hard walls.
The particle will be represented by a single unit of a 2D (or 3D) raster. The interactions
with the walls will be considered elastic, i.e. such interactions simply reverse the direction
of motion perpendicular to the wall.

### The first step is to create a box and a point particle with given coordinates within the box.
