# What can special characters in a paper on arxiv.org tell us?   (Preliminary title)

## Special characters in a paper on arxiv.org

We would like to characterize a paper on the arXiv by the special characters it contains. We start with the data available from https://mir.fi.muni.cz/MREC/.
We analyze this data to find out the frequency of special characters (like greek and/or mathematical symbols). We would like to study this as a function of
the time at which the paper appeared to see if there was a certain period of growth, stability, and decline of usage of that character.

## Data Science Objective

The eventual goal of the project is to use machine learning techniques to see if we can get meaningful information about the scientific content of a paper,
by studying the special characters used in it. We will use a small subset of papers as a training set to characterize the meaning of each special character.
The idea is to learn from the papers in the training set, where the algorithm learns about a special character by analyzing the words that appear close to 
it in the text.

More details on the project, the codes, and results will be made available here:
